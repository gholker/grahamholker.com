I joined as the 3rd engineer and touched most of the stack. 

Helpful started as a company directory app using AI and ML to help find people and later became a video messaging app. 

Things I worked on:

- Built solution for real-time speech recognition end-to-end from mobile clients to backend services to speech-to-text APIs
- Ideated and built a video editor based on the transcribed audio
- Designed search indices and optimized relevance (ElasticSearch)
- Implemented a paper to extract professional skills from text that included use of PageRank algorithm
- Developed a “person vector” model based on word vectors of Slack data that could find similar users using nearest neighbours search
- Developed Android app for recording and watching videos

Helpful was acquired by Shopify.
