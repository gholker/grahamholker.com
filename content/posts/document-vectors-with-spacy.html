/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

<p>In the above visualization we hope to find that similar sentences are close to each other. There are some bad examples too.</p>
<p>I found a few articles about Google potentially buying Twitch clustered together:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Google to Acquire Twitch for $1 Billion</code></li>
<li><code>Google/YouTube reportedly set to Buy Twitch for over $1 Billion</code></li>
<li><code>YouTube to acquire video game streaming service twitch for $1 billion?</code></li>
<li><code>Google reportedly buying acquiring live games video site Twitch for $1bn</code></li>
<li><code>Meet Twitch the video-streaming firm Google may buy for $1 billion</code></li>
<li><code>Is Google about to buy Twitch for $1bn?</code></li>
<li><code>In 2006, Google paid $1.65bn for YouTube. Now it's acquiring Twitch for $1bn</code></li>
<li><code>YouTube to buy Twitch for $1bn</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And not far from these:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Google to buy Skybox Imaging for at least $1b</code></li>
<li><code>Google to acquire micro-satellite company Skybox  for $1B</code></li>
</ul>
<p>But also nearby:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Adobe offers Photoshop for $9.99 per month until end of May</code></li>
<li><code>Sonic.Net Offering 1 Gbps, Unlimited Phone for $40 in California</code></li>
</ul>
<p>What is neat about this is that we didn't need a labeled data set to get started. Word vector models are able to be trained on unlabeled data (in this case Web data). Combined with the date of the article we could attempt to group stories about the same topic. Or we could recommend similar articles that a reader may be interested in.</p>
