My name is Graham and I'm an Android developer at Pivotal Labs Toronto.

I've shared the [code for my thesis work](https://github.com/gholker/MastersThesis) on GitHub. Related papers can be found in my list of [publications](publications.html).

Also on GitHub, a [Knowledge-Based System for designing electrical inductors](https://github.com/gholker/InductorKBS) built for a course during my Master's.
