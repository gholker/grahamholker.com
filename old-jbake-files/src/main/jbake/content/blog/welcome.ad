My name is Graham and I'm an Android developer at Pivotal Labs Toronto.

I've shared the https://github.com/gholker/MastersThesis[code for my thesis work] on GitHub. Related papers can be found in my list of link:publications.

Also on GitHub, a https://github.com/gholker/InductorKBS[Knowledge-Based System for designing electrical inductors] built for a course during my Master's.
